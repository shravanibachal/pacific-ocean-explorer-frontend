    The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions.
    It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south, 
    and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Oceania in the west and the Americas in the east.
                
    At 165,250,000 square kilometers in area, this largest division of the World Ocean and the 
    hydrosphere covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total 
    surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi))
                
    Ocean circulation subdivides it into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at 
    the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean can also 
    be informally divided by the International Date Line into the East Pacific and the West 
    Pacific, which allows it to be further divided into four quadrants, namely the Northeast 
    Pacific off the coasts of North America, the Southeast Pacific off South America,
    orthwest Pacific off Far Eastern Asia, and the Southwest Pacific around Oceania.</pre>
                
                        
                
                
                
                
                
                
    <h1><left>CLIMATE</left></h1>
    The climate patterns of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres generally mirror each other.
    In the tropical western Pacific, the monsoon and the related wet season during the summer 
    months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean from the Asian landmass.
    On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while September is the most active month. 
    November is the only month in which all the tropical cyclone basins are active.
    
    The Pacific hosts the two most active tropical cyclone basins, which are the northwestern Pacific and 
    the eastern Pacific. Pacific hurricanes form south of Mexico, sometimes striking the western Mexican 
    coast and occasionally the southwestern United States between June and October, while typhoons forming 
    in the northwestern Pacific moving into southeast and east Asia from May to December. Tropical cyclones 
    also form in the South Pacific basin, where they occasionally impact island nations.
    
    In the arctic, icing from October to May can present a hazard for shipping while persistent fog occurs 
    from June to December.A climatological low in the Gulf of Alaska keeps the southern coast wet and mild 
    during the winter months. The Westerlies and associated jet stream within the Mid-Latitudes can be 
    particularly strong, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, due to the temperature difference between 
    the tropics and Antarctica,which records the coldest temperature readings on the planet. In the Southern 
    hemisphere, because of the stormy and cloudy conditions associated with extratropical cyclones riding the 
    jet stream, it is usual to refer to the Westerlies as the Roaring Forties, Furious Fifties and Shrieking 
    Sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude.
                   
                
                   
     
    <h1><left>LOCATION</left></h1>
    Of the three major oceans, the Pacific is by far the largest, occupying about one-third of
    the surface of the globe. Its area, excluding the South China Sea, encompasses about 62.5 
    million square miles. The Pacific Ocean stretches from the Bering Strait to 60° S latitude 
    through more than 120° of latitude, nearly 9,000 miles. Its greatest latitudinal extent measures 
    some 12,000 miles along latitude 5° N, between the coasts of Colombia in South America and the 
    Malay Peninsula in Asia. The mean depth of the Pacific is 14,040 feet, and its greatest known depth 
    is 36,201 feet in the Mariana Trench—also the greatest depth found in any ocean.
    
    
    In the Northern Hemisphere the Pacific Ocean meets the Arctic Ocean in the Bering Sea. In the Southern 
    Hemisphere the Pacific and Atlantic mix in the relatively narrow Drake Passage between Tierra del Fuego 
    in South America and Graham Land in Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean meet at the 
    60° S parallel.
    
    
    The eastern boundary of the Pacific is associated with the American cordilleran system, which stretches 
    from Alaska in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south. Except for its extreme northern and southern 
    sections, which are characterized by fjords and their numerous off-lying islands, and except for the deeply 
    indented Gulf of California, the coastal boundary is relatively regular and the continental shelf narrow. 
    The western, or Asiatic, coastal boundary, in contrast, is irregular. Although the mountain systems there 
    lie roughly parallel to the coast, as they do on the eastern Pacific coastlands, the western Pacific is 
    noted for its many marginal seas. From north to south they include the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the 
    Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.

            The largest and deepest ocean in the world, the Pacific extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to Antarctica in the south. It covers 46% of the earth’s water surface and is larger than any landmass on earth.

The vast body of water is home to some of the most unusual life forms on earth. These unique animals are part of the sea’s amazing ecological diversity.

Because of its size and reach, there are dozens of countries that have coastlines on the Pacific. Among them are Australia, Chile, Fiji, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam.
