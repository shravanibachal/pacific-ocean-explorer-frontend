            <h1>RED ALGAE</h1>
        <pre>
                • Red algae is one of the oldest groups of eukaryotic algae.The Rhodophyta 
                  comprises one of the largest phyla of algae, containing over 7,000 
                  currently recognized species with taxonomic revisions ongoing.
                  
                • The majority of species (6,793) are found in the Florideophyceae (class), 
                  and mostly consist of multicellular, marine algae, including many notable 
                  seaweeds.Red algae are abundant in marine habitats but relatively rare in 
                  freshwaters.Approximately 5% of red algae species occur in freshwater 
                  environments, with greater concentrations found in warmer areas. 
            
                • The red algae form a distinct group characterized by having eukaryotic cells 
                  without flagella and centrioles, chloroplasts that lack external endoplasmic 
                  reticulum and contain unstacked (stroma) thylakoids, and use phycobiliproteins 
                  as accessory pigments, which give them their red color.But despite their name,  
                  red algae can vary greatly in color from bright green, soft pink, resembling 
                  brown algae, to shades of red and purple, and may be almost black at greater 
                  depths.

      </div>
    
      <div class="ox2">

        <pre>
            • Corals are colonial marine invertebrates within the class Anthozoa of 
              the phylum Cnidaria. They typically form compact colonies of many identical 
              individual polyps. Coral species include the important reef builders that 
              inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.

            • A coral "group" is a colony of very many genetically identical polyps. Each 
              polyp is a sac-like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a 
              few centimeters in height. 

            • Corals are major contributors to the physical structure of the coral reefs that 
              develop in tropical and subtropical waters.

          <h1>SEAGRASS</h1>
      <pre>
    
  • Seagrasses are the only flowering plants which grow in marine environments. The 
    name seagrass stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow 
    by rhizome extension and often spread across large "meadows" resembling grassland; 
    many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae.

  • Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic 
    zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or 
    mud bottoms. Most species undergo submarine pollination and complete their life 
    cycle underwater.
      
  • Seagrasses form dense underwater seagrass meadows which are among the most 
    productive ecosystems in the world. They function as important carbon sinks and 
    provide habitats and food for a diversity of marine life comparable to that of coral reefs.

        <h1>SEA ANEMONES</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="ll">
        
      <pre>
        • Sea anemones are a group of predatory marine invertebrates constituting the order 
          Actiniaria. Because of their colourful appearance, they are named after the Anemone, 
          a terrestrial flowering plant. 
       
        • A typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base, but 
          some species live in soft sediment, and a few float near the surface of the water. 
          The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and 
          a central mouth. The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded 
          to catch passing prey.
        
        • A sea anemone is capable of changing its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles 
          have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and 
          contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert, or the 
          oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing 
          the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds transversely and water is 
          discharged through the mouth.

        <h1>KELP</h1>
    <pre>

     • Kelps are large brown algae or seaweeds that make up the order Laminariales. 
       There are about 30 different genera. Kelp grows in "underwater forests" in 
       shallow oceans, and is thought to have appeared in the Miocene, 5 to 23 
       million years ago.The organisms require nutrient-rich water with temperatures 
       between 6 and 14 °C.
     
     • In most kelp, the thallus consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as 
       blades. Blades originate from elongated stem-like structures, the stipes. The 
       holdfast, a root-like structure, anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean. 
       Gas-filled bladders form at the base of blades of American species, such as 
       Nereocystis lueteana, to hold the kelp blades close to the surface.
        
    • Kelp may develop dense forests with high production, biodiversity and ecological 
      function. Along the Norwegian coast these forests cover 5800 km2, and they 
      support large numbers of animals. Numerous sessile animals are found on kelp 
      stipes and mobile invertebrate fauna are found in high densities on epiphytic algae 
      on the kelp stipes and on kelp holdfasts.

        <h1>RED SEA WHIP</h1>
    <pre>


    • The pink strands of this single deep-sea coral harbor a variety of marine life. 
      Sea whips are gorgonian corals and have flexible skeletons.    
            
    • Red Sea whip, any of several genera of corals of the order Gorgonacea, characterized 
      by a long, whiplike growth and a variety of bright colours. The “whip” consists of 
      a colony of tiny polyps that grow upon one another in a continuous single stem. 
      Spicules, or needlelike structures, of lime embedded in the polyp body provide a 
      firm but flexible support.

    • Red Sea Whip is found growing on rocks at depths down to 20 metres along the 
      western fringes of the Atlantic Ocean, commonly found on the coastal shelfs of 
      Southern states and on rock and limestone edges.
   
    • It has an upright growth habit with vertical, whip-like stems, sparsely 
      branching near the base. These are uniform in colour, ranging from white,
      yellow, and orange to shades of red and mauve. The polyps are arranged in
      several rows along both sides of each branch while the rows on older main 
      branches have distinct grooves between them, and when the polyps are retracted
      the calyces do not stick out
