        <h1>PACIFIC OCEAN</h1>
    <pre>
      • The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five oceanic divisions.
        It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean in the south,
        and is bounded by the continents of Asia and Oceania in the west and the Americas in the east.
                              
      • At 165,250,000 square kilometers in area, this largest division of the World Ocean and the
        hydrosphere covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about 32% of the planet's total 
        surface area, larger than its entire land area (148,000,000 km2 (57,000,000 sq mi)).
                              
      • Ocean circulation subdivides it into two largely independent volumes of water that meet at
        the equator, the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean can also 
        be informally divided by the International Date Line into the East Pacific and the West 
        Pacific, which allows it to be further divided into four quadrants, namely the Northeast 
        Pacific off the coasts of North America, the Southeast Pacific off South America,
        Northwest Pacific off Far Eastern Asia, and the Southwest Pacific around Oceania.  
        
      • The Pacific Ocean's mean depth is 4,000 meters (13,000 feet).Challenger Deep in the Mariana 
        Trench, located in the northwestern Pacific, is the deepest known point in the world, reaching 
        a depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet).

      • The Pacific also contains the deepest point in the Southern Hemisphere, the Horizon Deep in 
        the Tonga Trench, at 10,823 meters (35,509 feet).The third deepest point on Earth, the Sirena 
        Deep, is also located in the Mariana Trench.
     
      • The western Pacific has many major marginal seas, including the Philippine Sea, South China 
        Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Mar de Grau,  
        Tasman Sea, and the Coral Sea.The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest of Earth's five 
        oceanic divisions.
     
      • Across the continents of Asia, Australia and the Americas, more than 25,000 islands, large 
        and small, rise above the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Multiple islands were the shells of 
        former active volcanoes that have lain dormant for thousands of years. Close to the equator, 
        without vast areas of blue ocean, are a dot of atolls that have over intervals of time been 
        formed by seamounts as a result of tiny coral islands strung in a ring within surroundings 
        of a central lagoon.

        <h1>LOCATION</h1>
    <pre>
   •  Of the three major oceans, the Pacific is by far the largest, occupying about one-third of
      the surface of the globe. Its area, excluding the South China Sea, encompasses about 62.5 
      million square miles. The Pacific Ocean stretches from the Bering Strait to 60° S latitude 
      through more than 120° of latitude, nearly 9,000 miles. Its greatest latitudinal extent measures 
      some 12,000 miles along latitude 5° N, between the coasts of Colombia in South America and the 
      Malay Peninsula in Asia. The mean depth of the Pacific is 14,040 feet, and its greatest known depth 
      is 36,201 feet in the Mariana Trench—also the greatest depth found in any ocean.
   
   •  In the Northern Hemisphere the Pacific Ocean meets the Arctic Ocean in the Bering Sea. In the 
      Southern Hemisphere the Pacific and Atlantic mix in the relatively narrow Drake Passage between 
      Tierra del Fuego in South America and Graham Land in Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean and the 
      Southern Ocean meet at the 60° S parallel.
   
   
   •  The eastern boundary of the Pacific is associated with the American cordilleran system, which 
      stretches from Alaska in the north to Tierra del Fuego in the south. Except for its extreme 
      northern and southern sections, which are characterized by fjords and their numerous off-lying 
      islands, and except for the deeply indented Gulf of California, the coastal boundary is relatively 
      regular and the continental shelf narrow. The western, or Asiatic, coastal boundary, in contrast, 
      is irregular. Although the mountain systems there lie roughly parallel to the coast, as they do on 
      the eastern Pacific coastlands, the western Pacific is noted for its many marginal seas. From north 
      to south they include the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, the East
      China Sea, and the South China Sea.

        <h1>CLIMATE</h1>
    <pre>
    • The climate patterns of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres generally mirror each 
      other. In the tropical western Pacific, the monsoon and the related wet season during 
      the summer months contrast with dry winds in the winter which blow over the ocean 
      from the Asian landmass. On a worldwide scale, May is the least active month, while 
      September is the most active month.November is the only month in which all the 
      tropical cyclone basins are active.
            
    • The Pacific hosts the two most active tropical cyclone basins, which are the 
      northwestern Pacific and the eastern Pacific. Pacific hurricanes form south of Mexico,
      sometimes striking the western Mexican coast and occasionally the southwestern United 
      States between June and October, while typhoons forming in the northwestern Pacific 
      moving into southeast and east Asia from May to December. Tropical cyclones also form 
      in the South Pacific basin, where they occasionally impact island nations.
            
    • In the arctic, icing from October to May can present a hazard for shipping while persistent 
      fog occurs from June to December.A climatological low in the Gulf of Alaska keeps the 
      southern coast wet and mild during the winter months. The Westerlies and associated jet 
      stream within the Mid-Latitudes can be particularly strong, especially in the Southern 
      Hemisphere, due to the temperature difference between the tropics and Antarctica,which 
      records the coldest temperature readings on the planet. In the Southern hemisphere, because 
      of the stormy and cloudy conditions associated with extratropical cyclones riding the jet 
      stream, it is usual to refer to the Westerlies as the Roaring Forties, Furious Fifties and 
      Shrieking Sixties according to the varying degrees of latitude.

    <pre>
        The exploitation of the Pacific's mineral wealth is hampered by the ocean's great depths.
        In shallow waters of the continental shelves off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand, 
        petroleum and natural gas are extracted, and pearls are harvested along the coasts of 
        Australia, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Panama, and the Philippines, although in 
        sharply declining volume in some cases.

      • <b>FISHING </b>

        Fish are an important economic asset in the Pacific. The shallower shoreline waters of the 
        continents and the more temperate islands yield herring, salmon, sardines, snapper, swordfish, 
        and tuna, as well as shellfish.[90] Overfishing has become a serious problem in some areas. 
        Overfishing leads to depleted fish populations and closed fisheries, causing both economic and 
        ecologic consequences.[91] For example, catches in the rich fishing grounds of the Okhotsk Sea 
        off the Russian coast have been reduced by at least half since the 1990s as a result of overfishing.

      <h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
  <pre>

  • The Northwestern Pacific Ocean is most susceptible to micro plastic pollution. 
    The quantity of small plastic fragments floating in the north-east Pacific Ocean 
    increased a hundredfold between 1972 and 2012.

  • Marine pollution is a generic term for the harmful entry into the ocean of chemicals 
    or particles. The main culprits are those using the rivers for disposing of their 
    waste. The rivers then empty into the ocean, often also bringing chemicals used as 
    fertilizers in agriculture. The excess of oxygen- depleting chemicals in the water 
    leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.
  
  • Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has ended up 
    floating in a lake, sea, ocean, or waterway. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the 
    center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach 
    litter.
